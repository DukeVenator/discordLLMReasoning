// This file previously contained tests for private methods (_processMemorySuggestions, _formatMemoryForSystemPrompt)
// that were removed from LLMCordBot during refactoring.
// The core logic is now tested in tests/memory/MemoryManager.test.ts.
// This file can be kept empty or removed if no other LLMCordBot tests related specifically to
// memory *suggestion* processing (beyond integration) are needed here.

// Keeping vi import to avoid empty file errors if tooling requires it.
// Removed unused vi import

// Optionally add a placeholder test suite if needed for structure
// describe('LLMCordBot - Memory Suggestions (Placeholder)', () => {
//   it.todo('Add relevant integration tests if needed');
// });
